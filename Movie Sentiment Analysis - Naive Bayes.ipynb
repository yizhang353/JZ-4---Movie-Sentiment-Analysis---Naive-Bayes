       " 'this review contains spoilers  i didn t have any expectations about this movie  i pulled it off the video store rack with the movie   white noise    br    br   first  the credits for this stupid movie run about   minutes into it  the pacing from start to finish is slooooow  the main heroines don t like to wear a bra and the director appears to enjoy the jiggle effect as anna paquin descends the stairs  if you like movies for boobies  this one has a low level buzz factor  br    br   second  it s nice that the movie rips off elements of lovecraft and other horror genre mechanisms  but in better movies  there is at least some rational or consistently irrational behavior  this stinker tries to establish some sense of modernity and reality but then you have situations where no one calls the police even though they ve uncovered a treasure trove of potentially incriminating forensic evidence  and otherworldly rituals are nicely spelled out in a comprehensive book on otherworldly rituals like on buffy  i was waiting for miles to show up and give some consultation on how to slay a certain demon type of so and so  br    br   the premise is that it is possible to open up an age of darkness where creatures that crawl on the ceiling can cut your throat or turn the meat grinder effect on you  ho hum  to do this you need to have a sacrificial circle and then have seven kids who must have their throat cuts by people who love them  this opens the world to the age of darkness  at least that s what it says in complete detail in the book of ancient occult rituals  which raises the annoying question of  uh  well  how did the ones who wrote the book know  and  if this is what happens  would you really leave this information in a book you can take out from the library  much less get it from a library in a world that is not covered already in darkness  an age brought on by lunatics who could have performed this like much earlier using the   occult practices to bring the world to darkness for dummies   nd edition    it turns out the father in the story is the  th child  the one that ran away from the ritual    years ago  he was released by his father  who is the doctor grandfather in the movie  who wanted to try the ritual with presumably  other stupid parents  who just wanted to see if dumb sh t like this opening the world to darkness actually works  the grandpa let the father go because he   didn t really love him    aduh  stupid stupid movie written by a moronic director who appears to think he s some kind of eurofilm auteur  there s also a scene in the movie where the kid appears with big welts on his face and the mother grabs him and has this total lack of reaction  the whole movie is like this  people seeing really weird sh t going on and not reacting to it in any sort of normal way  must be bad plot and direction  br    br   anna paquin does her best to play her character realistically without cracking a smirk  and she does look smashing in a halter top  but at several critical moments in the story  her character doesn t bother to call in for back up  you know  more of the same    i will walk into a likely demonic evil situation without any knowledge of defense or help from others carrying flashlights or firepower even though i sense impending doom    and even dumber as it may seem  even if you bring on the age of darkness  these creatures who make you bloody can t attack if you have a light source  but they appear as people you know  and tell you to turn off the light source  reminds me of the video game   alone in the dark    maybe this movie is a rip off of that game s concept  br    br   the best actors in the film are the young kid and anna  they both die at the end  the entire family dies  the darkness creatures lead them to their death  but really  the stupidity of the characters in the family was the main cause of death  the other adults could be interchangeable with any other actors from the red shoes diaries series of fine cinema  br    br   so to wrap up  the worst things about this movie are the stupidity of the characters in bumping around blindly in an obviously abnormal situation  the really crap plot  there is an old architect in the story who designs a house with a sacrificial altar hidden in it   the architect has suspected from the beginning there would be occult sacrifices in the house but doesn t tell anyone because  well  no real reason  they couldn t find the kids  but he didn t bother to tell authorities about the hidden rooms which he designed into the house but he does like to hang around the house for a    year period because he worries about what is going on inside   derrrrh   duuuuh   the hackneyed use of scare mechanisms  more children standing around in the dark or only showing up in photographs  and blood on the wallpaper   and the egotism of the director which when you see him in the dvd features describing his crap work as a new and original rendition  makes you understand where the real horror of this movie lies  br    br   is it entertaining  at  x speed on a dvd player with the subtitles turned on  it can be entertaining  until your reach the end and realize the movie is crap  otherwise it draaaaaaaags on  the cinematic equivalent of a fatty shake  the empty calories are horrid  br    br   the movie gives the feeling the director must have seen   the ring   and wanted to attempt to create something similar in mood  which in this respect  the film fails miserably  and so  also  in this respect  jaume balaguer   it is my opinion that you suck at what you do  ',\n",

were   rumours   but it was then mentioned that russell t davies was going to executively produce and write the show and then one saturday afternoon in march      channel   news interviewed the actor cast in the title role   christopher eccleston   yes that christopher eccleston an actor i ve always been impressed by since watching his film debut in let him have it and if he was getting interviewed on television it must have been true   as the months passed more and more information was leaked   billie piper was being cast   the daleks would be returning and the mill   the hollywood effects company who had done the fx for gladiator were contracted to do the special effects for the show   for several weeks before the first broadcast trailers galore heralded the return of the new series   massive billboards in london informed the public about the return of the show   tabloid newspapers carried massive photo spreads of the aliens appearing and christopher eccleston appeared on programmes as diverse as blue peter   mastermind   which had a special doctor who night edition     this morning and friday night with johnathan ross   in fact this new series of doctor who must have been the most hyped programme in the history of british television   it had better be bloody good  br    br   so was it bloody good   undoubtedly it has been a major success with nearly every episode making the top ten shows in the tv charts   to give you clue of its rating success only one episode   the ark in space episode two   febuary        from the old series had made it into the top five tv chart   the opening series episode made number three with two more episodes either beating or equalling the previous record and this is in an era where there s far more competition in terms of tv stations and choice   let s laugh and cheer at the fact doctor who stuffed hit me baby one more time   celebrity wrestling and mauled ant and dec s saturday night takeaway   of course much of the success is down to the breath taking visuals and the casting of a well known prestigious actor in the role   for the most part everything you see on screen here equals anything you ll see in a spielberg   hollywood movie   there s a dalek invasion force numbering tens of thousands   exotic aliens   a   th century cardiff that looks like a   th century cardiff and night filming that is actually night filming and not done by sticking a dark filter over the screen   i promise you ll be hearing a lot more from the directors who worked on this series   joe ahearne especially will one day be in the hollywood a list  br    br   there are some flaws to the new series of doctor who and all of them should be laid at the door of russell t davies   it may be contentious whether the soap opera and post modernist elements are successful or not   in my opinion they re not   but what s not in dispute is that the weakest scripts are all written by rtd   as i mentioned in my review of casanova he cheats the audience and he does the same thing here  when faced by armed soldiers pointing their guns at him the doctor bellows    attack plan delta    which makes no sense to anyone in the audience but allows him to escape from a tight spot   a naked captain jack suddenly pulls out a laser he s been hiding and rtd scripts are full of these type of cheats and deus ex machina type endings   in fact the final episode is spoiled greatly by the ridiculous concept of what the    bad wolf    is which seems to have got rtd out of a tight spot more than the doctor   and of the endings i m trying to remember if any of them were actually down to the doctor   more often than it s a supporting character or the doctor s companion who saves the day   the show is called doctor who not rose tyler so can we see the title character save the day please just like he did in the classic series   one final point about the portrayal of the doctor is the way he s written as a grinning loon   eccleston is best known for his serious and gloomy roles and he s absolutely breath taking at scenes when he s showing grief   like the tear running down his face in the end of the world but more often than not he s written as a    tom baker on speed    character   it s obvious why eccleston hasn t done much comedy in his career   he s not very good at it  br    br   am i starting to sound like i hate this show   sorry i didn t mean to but it s just that while some anticipations have been met or surpassed some others haven t and they re nearly all down to russell t davies who thankfully is contributing less in the way of scripts in the next series of doctor who   let s see more traditional stories of a human outpost being under threat from monsters like we saw in the     s and   s   imagine a story like the sea devils with a massive budget directed by joe ahearne   oh and one last request   can we see these    next time    trailers scrapped   they reveal all the best bits of next

       " 'i honestly don t know where to begin when reviewing a movie as pathetic as ernest goes to africa  aside from two or three good laughs dispersed throughout the film  there is nothing positive about this hour and a half waste of time and life  it is incredible that someone was able to round up a group of people willing to act  film  and edit this piece of trash  and even more incredible that this is the eighth installment in the ernest series  br    br   during the opening credits of the movie  we see ernest posing next to various african objects  such as wooden masks and the heads of african animals  making faces and gestures that would probably make most  rd graders laugh  this opening scene gives the viewer a taste of ernest s frequent attempts at humor  and demonstrates how his comedy falls flat     of the time  br    br   the first thing that really hit me about this movie is how bad the acting is  everyone in the film is a typical c movie actor  but linda kash stands out as especially terrible  she is the epitome of overacting  all of her lines are delivered with shockingly inhuman enthusiasm that you d find only in a middle school play  most high school theater students probably could have replaced these actors and delivered a more powerful performance  jim varney at least displays some comedic ability every now and then  but for the majority of the movie he just acts like a complete retard  trying to be humorous by making stupid faces and speaking in different voices  br    br   ernest goes to africa begins in africa  where an archaeologist has stolen two priceless gems from an african tribe  the gems then make their way back to the united states  where an unidentified man is seen running from several henchmen through a flea market  he hides them in a bucket of  two for a dollar   items  and then runs from the scene  ernest is looking for a gift to buy for rene  a waitress he likes  so he goes to the flea market and of course buys the priceless gems  he later takes them back to his house  paints them  and glues them together to make a yo yo  he gives the yo yo to rene and she explains that they can never be together because he is just an average shmoe  and she wants a man of adventure  rene and ernest are tracked down by the henchmen  and are then brought to africa to be kept as prisoners  br    br   most of the movie really doesn t make sense  once ernest is in africa  he falls out of the truck that they are carrying him in and lands in a river  in the next scene  we see him as a hindu servant named   hey you    his skin is dark and he is wearing a loin cloth  at first  i thought jim varney was playing another role in the film in addition to ernest  but i immediately recognized ernest s idiocy once hey you began to speak  br    br   another scene that sticks out in my mind as being completely ridiculous is the car chase scene in the african wilderness  rene and ernest have taken an ostrich farmer s truck and are being chased by the henchmen  driving at about twenty miles per hour on a fairly straight road  both henchmen are shooting at ernest  who is in the back of the ostrich farmer s truck  ernest  on the other hand  is throwing ostrich eggs at the henchmen and their driver  the henchmen never hit ernest once during the five minute chase  but ernest is able to fend them off by hitting them and their driver in the face  making their car swerve off the road and explode in a giant column of smoke  i should also add that ernest is slingshotting the eggs  two at a time  from a large bra  br    br   the set design is also incredibly poor in this movie  there is a large portion of the film in which rene and ernest are walking in africa  trying to find civilization  during their hike  we see them walking through fields and jungles  which probably could have been shot anywhere in the united states  the fields are simply plain grassy fields  with no indication whatsoever of being anywhere near africa  they could have at least digitally added some african trees in the background   and the jungles look like the woods of rural connecticut with papier m ch  skulls  vines  and thorns hanging from trees  according to imdb com  the film was actually shot in south africa  but i still wouldn t believe that at all  br    br   the movie goes on and on  ernest joke after ernest joke  the rest of the movie doesn t really make any sense either  the african tribesmen all speak english for some reason  and ernest is later challenged to a   battle of truth   by the lead henchman  who is suddenly dressed in an outfit that resembles that of a ninja  yet also somewhat resembles that of a bondage submissive  the henchman has a table of axes  swords  knives  and maces before him  while ernest has a table with a sandwich  a teddy bear  and a few other worthless items  however  ernest wins the battle and somehow ends up saving the day  br    br   overall  this movie is painful to watch  i couldn t handle it in one sitting  i had to stop halfway through and do something productive for a few hours to compensate for the brain cells lost while trying to appreciate varney s humor  they should really put a surgeon s general warning on the box to let people know that they will in fact be slightly more retarded upon finishing this movie  i would have to say that out of all the movies i have

       " 'director mikhail kalatozov s film the cranes are flying  letyat zhuravli  is a glorious piece of cinema  from the screenplay by viktor rozov  based on his own play  kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering by those left at home  inundated with countless war movies showing us the frontlines and the carnage  the topic itself becomes tedious and avoidable  however  this russian gem shows how the tale of hardship can be told in a different way  by telling us  straight from a soldier s mouth how war is hated by all  that they hope those who died did so for a cause that will allow for peace and the end of fighting  we see a new vision of wwii  we have young men volunteering to wage war for peace  to keep their families and loved ones safe at home rather than draftees fighting a battle they don t believe in  with so much hatred towards our current situation in the middle east  and how people are dying for no reason  against their will  it s nice to see a film that shows just how selfless and heroic these soldiers are  as well as those awaiting their return  br    br   communist russia shows how involved all were in the war  while boris may have volunteered to go to the frontlines  his father is head doctor of a hospital aiding in the mending of soldiers injured and his sister is helping him there as well as his girl veronika  doing all she can to keep her mind off the fact that no letter has arrived from her love  an entire city comes out to send the boys off in celebration  even the factory that boris and his friend stepan work for send representatives over with gifts of gratitude  whether this is all a glorified look into russia at the outset of wwii or not  i don t know  there are no protests or badmouthing of these boys risking their lives for a country  it is all praise and thanks  some in america could learn a lesson from this because whether you agree with the war at hand or not  protesting and wreaking havoc in its name only sullies what these men and women are sacrificing each and everyday  br    br   the acting is top notch throughout  but some deserve singling out  i really enjoyed antonina bogdanova in a small role as boris  grandmother  she is the one family member he can trust and her sadness at his leaving is very evident on her face and through her body language  vasili merkuryev  as the patriarch fyodor ivanovich  brings what is perhaps the best performance  as spoken at the end  about fathers needing to choke back hidden tears  merkuryev epitomizes those sentiments  he puts on a tough exterior  especially cracking jokes and riding his son hard when he finds out about his volunteering just hours before he must leave  but when boris exits to go to the assembly station we see the true pain of the man  seated in sorrow at the table  he loves his son dearly and although he may not be able to show it to him  his actions throughout the film express it to the audience  aleksey batalov is effective as boris  a happy go lucky young man  and idealist  doing what he believes is right  and aleksandr shvorin is good as the villainous mark  staying home due to his talented piano skills  or maybe just to steal his cousin s love  that love  played by tatyana samojlova  really draws the audience in to her grief  dejection  and slim glimmer of hope  the true star of the film  she must go through many emotions on a journey where she does lose her way  needing to steer back on course  hoping that she did so soon enough for boris  return  br    br   besides the realism to the story  as well as being unafraid to use tragedy to get the theme across  i also loved the visual style of the film  sergei urusevsky s cinematography is amazing  especially when considering the movie was shot in fullscreen  it is one thing to create stunning compositions in a widescreen panorama  it is completely different to do so in a square frame  right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding walkway along water  a bridge in the background at the top  as our two lovers skip their way up the screen and into the distance  there are multiple instances of the camera being behind barriers yet still allowing for the action to be seen  creating unique spatial depth and interest at all times  sharp angles are utilized  as well as careful blocking to allow for overhead shots and exaggerated juxtapositions of characters in frame together  br    br   the real feats  however  are those instances of the long shot  used well towards the end to follow veronika through the mass of returning soldiers  it is magnificent earlier on as she roams through those saying goodbye to their loved ones while she searches for boris  her own farewell needing to be said  the planning for this shot must have been extensive because while she weaves in and out of people  the camera focuses on couples kisses  people yelling to one another  and more  all purposely in frame at specific moments while the camera moves through  everyone needed to hit his mark precisely and it leads to a brilliant piece of cinema  it s just one part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style  the cranes are flying shows how successful placement and mise en sc ne can be in showing the audience what it needs in as simple a way as possible  composition and professionalism from the actors and crew can work wonders  adding something that huge setpieces and special effects can never do ',\n",

sufficient  if you have the dvd of md  you can  cheat   by looking at david lynch s   top    hints to unlocking md    but only upon second or third viewing  please      br    br   first of all  mulholland drive is downright brilliant  a masterpiece  this is the kind of movie that refuse to leave your head  not often are the comments on the dvds very accurate  but vogue s   it gets inside your head and stays there   really hit the mark  br    br   david lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look to it   cinematography wise  has great acting  esp  naomi watts   a haunting soundtrack by badalamenti  and a very dream like quality to it    but on top of it all it also manages to involve the viewer in such a way that few movies have before   after all  when is the last time you saw a movie that just wouldn t leave your mind and that everyone felt compelled to talk and write about  regardless of whether they liked it or hated it   br    br   allright  enough about all that  it s time to justify those statements  br    br   most people that have gone through some effort to try to piece the plot together will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion a dream sequence  br    br   of course  that s too bad for all those trying to make sense of the movie by expecting   traditional   methods in which the story is laid out in a timely  logic and linear manner for the viewer  but for those expecting that  i urge you to check the name of the director and come back again     br    br   md is the story of the sad demise of diane selwyn  a wannabe actor who is hopelessly in love with another actor  camilla rowles  due to diane s lack of talent  she is constantly struggling to advance her career  and feels she failed to deliver on her own and her parents  expectations  upon realizing that camilla will never be hers  c  becomes engaged with adam kesher  the director   she hires a hitman to get rid of her  and subsequently has to deal with the guilt that it produces  br    br   the movie first starts off with what may seem as a strange opening for this kind of thriller  which is some   s dance jitterbug contest  in which we can see the main character betty giving a great performance  we also see an elderly couple  which we will see twice more throughout the movie  together with her  and applauding her  br    br   no  wait  this is what most people see the first time they view it  there s actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits   the camera moving into an object  although blurry  and the scene quickly fading out  if you look closely  the object is actually a pillow  revealing that what follows is a dream  br    br   the main characters seen in the first half of the movie  br    br   betty  diane selwyn s imaginary self  used in the first half of the movie that constitutes the   dream sequence     a positive portrayal of a successful  aspiring young actor  the complete opposite of diane    betty  was chosen as the name as that is the real name of the waitress at winkies  notice that in the dream version  the waitresses  name is  diane   br    br   rita  the fantasy version of camilla rhodes that  through diane s dream  and with the help of an imaginary car accident  is turned into an amnesiac  this makes her vulnerable and dependent on diane s love  she is then conveniently placed in betty diane s aunt s luxurious home which betty has been allowed to stay in  br    br   coco  in real life  adam s mother  in the dream part  the woman in charge of the apartment complex that betty stays in  she s mainly a strong authority figure  as can be witnessed in both parts of the film  br    br   adam  the director  we know from the second half that he gets engaged with camilla  his sole purpose for being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a punching bag for betty diane  since she develops such hatred towards him  br    br   aunt ruth  diane s real aunt  but instead of being out of town  she is actually dead  diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for camilla s murder  br    br   mr  roach  a typical lynchian character  not real  appears only in diane s dream sequence  he s a mysterious  influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair  he serves much of the same function as the backwards talking dwarf  which he also plays  in twin peaks  br    br   the hitman  the person that murders camilla  this character is basically the same in both parts of the movie  although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence  more on that below   br    br   now  having established the various versions of the characters in the movie  we can begin to delve into the plot  of course i will not go into every little detail  neither will i lay it out chronologically   but i will try to explain some of the important scenes  in relation to lynch    hint sheet    br    br   as i mentioned above  camilla was re produced as an amnesiac through her improbable survival of a car accident in the first    minutes of the movie  which left her completely vulnerable  what i found very intriguing with md  is that lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what isn t  i ve already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow  but notice how there s two cars riding in each lane approaching the limo  br    br   only one of the cars actually hit the limo  what about the other  even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves  wouldn t they try to help the others  or at least call for help  my theory is that  since this is a dream  the presence of the other car is just set aside  and forgotten about  since  as rogert ebert so eloquently puts it   like real dreams  it does not explain  does not complete its sequences  lingers over what it finds fascinating  dismisses unpromising plotlines    br    br   shortly after rita crawls down from the crash site at mulholland dr   and makes her way down the hillside and sneaks into aunt ruth s apartment  betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away  staring ghoulishly at each other and grinning at themselves and the camera  this is the first indication that what we re seeing is a nightmare  br    br   although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to betty  i think they re actually her parents  since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest   perhaps she didn t know them all that well  and didn t really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted  so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream  they also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder  and diane s sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her life  br    br   a rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman  diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept camilla s part in the movie  from adam s party in the second half of the movie   and he therefore occupies a major part of her dream  because of her feelings of guilt and remorse towards the murder of camilla  a part of her wants him to miss  so she turns him into a dumb criminal  br    br   this scene  i think  is also lynch s attempt at totally screwing his audience over  since they re given a false pretence in which to view the movie  br    br   gotta love that  something just bit me bad  line  though     br    br   the next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at twinkies  who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that they re sitting in  after a little talk  they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence  accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scene  br    br   when reaching the corner  a bum like character with a disfigured face appears out from behind the corner  scaring the living crap out of the man having the nightmare  this nightmare exists only in diane s mind  she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder  so  in short  her obessions translate into that poor guy s nightmares  the bum also signifies diane s evil side  as can be witnessed later in the movie  br    br   the cowboy constitutes  along with the dwarf  one of the strange characters that are always present in the lynchian landscape    diane only saw him for a short while at adam s party  but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams  so can he be awarded an important part in her dream  we are also given further clues during his scenes that what we re seeing is not real  his sudden disappearance  etc   br    br   the cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the director  when he meets up with him at the odd location  the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream   also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he  adam  does good  or two more times if he does bad  throughout the movie he appears two more times  indicating to diane that she did bad  he is also the one to wake her up to reality  that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her requirements of him appearing twice   and shortly thereafter she commits suicide  br    br   the espresso scene with the castigliane brothers  where we can see badalamenti  the composer  as luigi  is probably a result of the fact that diane was having an espresso just before camilla and adam made their announcement at adam s party in the second half  it could at the same time also be a statement from lynch  br    br   during the scene in which they enter diane s apartment  the body lying in the bed is camilla  but notice how she s assumed diane s sleeping position  diane is seeing herself in her own dream  but the face is not hers  although it had the same wounds on the face as diane would have after shooting herself  this scene is also filled with some genuine lynchian creepiness  since diane did not know where  or when  the hitman would get to camilla and finish her off  she just put her into her own home  br    br   in real life  diane s audition for the movie part was bad  in her dream  she delivers a perfect audition   leaving the whole crew ecstatic about her performance  br    br   also interesting is the fact that the money that in real life was used to pay for camilla s murder now appears in rita camilla s purse  this is part of diane s undoing of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back  as the murder now hasn t taken place  br    br   when her neighbor arrives to get her piano shaped ashtray  another hint is given  she takes the ashtray from her table and leaves  yet later when camilla and betty have their encounter on the couch  we see the ashtray appear again when the camera pans over the table  suggesting that betty s encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy  br    br   the catch phrase of the movie adam is auditioning actresses for is   she is the girl    which are the exact same words that diane uses when giving the hitman camilla s photo resume  br    br   the blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie  and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed  there s much symbolism going on here  the box may represent diane s future  it s empty   or it may be a sort of a pandora s box  the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open   either way  it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key  which is placed next to her after the murder has taken place   the box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disfigured bum  br    br   club silencio is a neat little addition to further remind the viewer that what s he is viewing is not real  it also signifies that diane is about to wake up to her reality  her reality being a nightmare that she is unable to escape from  even in her dreams   br    br   during the chilling scene at the end where the creepy old couple reappear  diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out in order to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fears  br    br   anyway  that is my        hope this could help people from bashing out at this movie and calling it  the worst movie ever  or something to that effect  without realizing the plot  br    br   as usual  lynch is all about creating irrational fears  and he certainly achieves that with this picture as well  br    br      out of     ',\n",

over their destinies  and also suggest the stalinist power that is never  specifically  mentioned in the film  although the pair seem to be free in space  whether literally in an unpeopled environment  or privileged in generous close ups  they are always ironised  minimised  torn apart   by circumstances  families  by crowds  see the brilliant  if obvious  sequences where veronika is engulfed by tanks  or the pair fail to meet in a huge crowd   or simply by the film s structure  which is constantly distancing  through paralellism  their closeness  although at the beginning  the lightness and brightness of style suggest a beautiful romantic idyll  it is constantly being broken by strange edits or camera angles of distracting snatches of music  br    br   what is most remarkable is how these blocks to romance are achieved by abstracting rather than emphasising historical forces  the whole film  but especially the war itself  is strangely unreal and dreamlike  we are never shown its harsh  brutal actuality  just its effects on the lovers  in fact  it is transformed into a majestic spectacle  devoid of nasty germans   br    br   on the home front  the air raids create delicious effects of light and shade  or ruins of almost gothic decadence  in the bunker  the threat to the soviet empire is less important than boris s perceived indifference  the empty  oneiric moscow spaces the lovers initially  than veronika with her mother  walk though are less actual locations than emotional spaces   br    br   when mark tries to force himself on veronika  the air raid is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations  this is a brilliant sequence  filmed with silent  expressionistic terror  in which the screen seems to burst with hysteria and violence  all the more compelling for the earlier scenes  wistful gentleness  br    br   it s not much different at the front either  where fights over girls  honour are more urgent than tactics  nazis or despair  the movement of boris and his wounded comrade into a final space is a further abstracting of the experience of war  its setting in a forest giving it a sexual dynamic  and boris  final  pre death flashback is an extraordinary mixture of dream wish fulfillment and heightened anxiety  in which what is wished for becomes menacing and grotesque  br    br   from this point on the film becomes a little less interesting  slightly more obvious  one more grasp for expressionist overload   veronika s attempted suicide and her rescuing the infant   is clumsily handled  and her sombre guilt casts a paralysing shadow over the whole film  the use of deep focus  at first ravishing  soon becomes wearing  devoid as it is of any of the moral force or meaning welles brought to its use in citizen kane  after what seems a quietly sly critique of totalitarianism in favour of the individual is cruelly betrayed at the end  when individual suffering  as so often in russian art  transmutes into symbolic  i e  sexless  dehumanised  hope  a pity ',\n",

unfortunately  only a handful of them were ever exported to the rest of the europe and the united states    battle of the eagles   is a rare  low budget look at the formation and exploits of the partisan air force  br    br   marshal tito decrees that a partisan air force must be formed to combat the german luftwaffe in the skies over yugoslavia  a group of former pilots join forces with two small biplanes and begin raiding enemy bases and convoys  over the course of several months  more pilots and planes join the ranks  eventually forming a formidable air force  maybe it s history  or maybe it s fable   whatever it is  it sure isn t convincing  but a cast of great actors sure try to make it work  br    br   the film opens strongly with a well shot german air raid on defenseless partisans  the nuts and bolts of the plot come together almost immediately  and for a short while the audience is treated to a rather patriotic series of scenes  then the action starts  and this title quickly becomes yet another low budget  by the numbers adventure  all of the characters are familiar clich s  major dragan  played by a well meaning bekim fehmiu  is our typical patriotic  heroic leading man  he blasts away at strafing planes with a machine gun and even has an aerial duel with the villainous klauberg  radko polic   a completely predictable and corny climax with an equally predictable outcome  the rest of the partisans are familiar  ljubisa samardzic    the battle of neretva    is a zare  a hotshot playboy  bata zivojinovic    hell river    is voss  a veteran flyer who comes out of the woodwork now that his country needs him  and rados bajic    the day that shook the world    is dalibor  a young messenger boy who moves up through the ranks  eventually becoming a seasoned combat pilot  the characters and their stories are familiar to any war fan  and krvavac doesn t try to build upon these stereotypes  the cast does a fair job  and despite the two dimensional script  every player is engaging and fun to watch  bajic  in particular  has some great moments   when he s going to take his first flight as a gunner  and later  when he is forced to land a plane after the pilot is killed  the plot merely consists of a string of air raids against the germans  and subsequent retaliatory acts  br    br   krvavac handles the action sequences competently with a mix of actual footage and miniature effects  unfortunately  the miniatures are so cheap and false looking that the transitions between actual aerial photography and toy planes are jarring and laughable  some of the strafing and bombing scenes look shockingly real  while dogfights involving scale models  complete with action figure pilots  are just plain pathetic  sometimes smoke puffs from the   machine guns   are so big that the smoke engulfs the entire model plane  worse  the editors often superimpose shots of fighters over real footage  although the aircraft are usually in proper perspective  they re surrounded by a distracting glow which hinders any attempt at realism  all of this action is set to an incredibly familiar and annoying score by bojan adamic  br    br     battle of the eagles   also suffers from a very poorly edited english language release  to begin with     minutes of footage is missing   cutting the film from     minutes to a mere      the missing segments were carelessly excised  and the cutting looks very sloppy  music cues are abruptly cut off and scenes are abandoned before they are resolved  in the last third of the film  the story falls apart  and only some badly needed action scenes can try to save it from total incomprehensibility  then  there s the dubbing  all of the scenes revolving around the partisans are dubbed in english  rather poorly  however   yet several lengthy scenes remain in german  without the benefit of subtitles  the film might have made much more sense had the german language sequences been excised instead of crucial scenes revolving around the partisans  br    br   on the plus side  krvavac handles the outdoor footage quite well  there is never a moment where the audience feels like they re on a soundstage  in particular  the german luftwaffe bases are expansive  complete with dozens of messerschmitt fighter planes and extras costumed in leather flying jackets  the scenery is fresh and green  and krvavac isn t afraid to shoot scenes with extremely wide angles or from far away simply to convey the scope of a battle or long trek  a german ambush of a partisan unit early on in the picture stands out  as does a sequence where zare and dalibor escape from an enemy base  br    br   as it exists on home video    battle of the eagles   is just another of many stories about the yugoslav partisan movement

the warden and quits his job on the spot  do doctors and dentists not have the right to request not to see certain prisoners  after poet and o reilly make the announcement to the entire prison  robson asks to see dr  faraj  and is escorted to his office  brought in without knocking  and the guard promptly leaves without a word  they might as well give him a gun  br    br   i shouldn t go on about stupid ideas in this show  but it s like a flood  i can t stop it  who thought of the chinese refugees who can t speak chinese and who disappear en masse from sight unless they re needed  who thought of the goofy religious wars and all the reverend prisoners  who though of robson s gum transplant  what s the deal with busmalis and agamemnon  agamemnon because he clearly doesn t belong in prison and busmalis because of the whole thing with his grandson  macbeth  because it was nothing but a ridiculous means to an end  as it were   br    br   but what are the worst ideas  things that go nowhere  which are constant  an irish man comes to the prison and builds a bomb  he threatens to blow up the entire prison  the bomb turns out to be a dud  and the episode ends with him being led away by the bomb squad after the entire prison is evacuated  nothing is ever heard from him or about the whole situation again  it s like it never happened  in one episode  prisoners are given dogs to train  what the hell   if that wasn t bad enough  during one training session  a guard fires his gun inside the prison walls as a training exercise  no one seems to mind  br    br   i also like how anytime some kind of altercation breaks out  the culprits are pulled aside  they don t say anything  and the guards or warden or sister pete or whoever always says    i hope you don t think i m gonna let this go     and then they walk away and let it go  the audience won t remember   br    br   maybe i m spoiled by prison break  but oz is just a goofy prison drama that might be better as a play  a short one  at least a low budget movie  there is just not enough here to sustain a multi season tv show  then again  i watched six seasons of it on dvd  sometimes i don t understand myself    ',\n",

there is one particular case in this where that is inaccurate  i won t spoil it here  for anyone who haven t yet tried it  nevertheless  regardless of how little experience you have with computers  you can sit right down and try this  there isn t even terribly many bits of this where you need to be fast or have swift reflexes  heck  you can adjust the speed of the text if you have it have subtitles on   and thus  of the talking in it  and it s not enormously awkward or forced when slow  accessing your inventory is easy  as well as combining or using items  clicking and holding down the

two difficulty settings you try this on  at your own pace  and explore and take in the dozens of individual  creatively done characters and areas in this to your heart s content  the length of this will be determined by how much time you take to do such you ll hear no blame from me  they re worth it   and your skill at figuring out the solutions  there are a few points in this where you get to decide if you want the harder way of completing that or not  this can be enjoyed by anyone  from any age  there s no material that isn t acceptable for children  this is one of the products that help prove that that very fact does not have to mean that it is intolerable for older audiences  the animation is quality work  smooth  everything moves as it should  and the  rd dimension honestly isn t that sorely missed when trying this  the story telling is well done  and you re never unclear as to what is going on  there are numerous well directed cut scenes  kept in the same colorful  mostly bright  d world as the rest  with well done camera motion   cartoony   is an appropriate word to describe this  and not only the visual style  it can be applied to all of this  the entire world of this is very similar to  but not quite the same as  ours  with a mix of past and present  inhabited by people and filled with things that we can sort of recognize or understand at least portions of  but the absurdity makes them funny  that would have to be one of the greatest strengths of this  right there  it s hilarious  a lot of that comes from the lines spoken what is said as well as how it is   and those who dig british efforts with focus on verbal  the likes of  allo  allo or the blackadder franchise will want to check this sucker out  however  there are several different types of jokes  including  but not limited to the following  satire  cleverness  dark  spoofs  irony  gross out comedy not exactly my favorite aspect of this  and more  there s self awareness  with the lead addressing you  personally  and  for example  explaining why he isn t going to do what you just asked him to  there are references to pop culture through a couple of decades  almost all of it works  hardly any gags fall flat  and if you aren t in stitches during this  my best guess as to the reason would be that it s simply not compatible with your sense of humor    a situation that warrants no judgment  and if one suspects that could be the case  and wishes to find out  i suggest the demo version  where you  for free  can see if you care for the brand of play and or laughter  the plot is well written nearly all of this is  really   develops nicely throughout and keeps your interest well  the audio is all excellent  crisp and well done  the sound effects are spot on  the music is well composed with no exceptions  the voice acting is impeccable  with a celebrity or two  armato is fantastic as guybrush threepwood gotta love that name   whom you control  boen is incredible as lechuck  the deceased and still threatening  zombie villain  the designs are immensely well done  highly imaginative and all fit  in spite of the relatively limited disposition of our hero when it comes to pirate deeds  you do get to engage in some  steer a ship  board that of others  and match blades in a rather unique  and marvelously thought up  way  the re playability lies mainly in the choices  during dialog  etc  this is linear  with a tad freedom as far as the order goes  so the buccaneer sitting down with this  for at least the second time  has not got that large an amount of possibilities as far as being challenged by this goes  unless he or she has forgotten what to do in the meantime  ah  nothing is perfect  anyone who would care to delve into a thoroughly well crafted and fascinating fictional universe  and crack up countless times should get a real kick out of this  the good kind  not the ones that hurt and potentially leave bruises  don t forget  kids  do  not  eat books    that is just begging for a paper cut  i would wager a guess that those who like the others would appreciate this one  too  and they re not the only ones who may get into this  i recommend

are flying and bodies are dying in a gun skirmish over the opening credits  where the intensity of the film never lets up throughout the duration  focusing on grim faces  worn out soldiers with next to nothing to eat  a terrified population under occupation  starving children with petrified mothers  all cast in an immense landscape of endless white snow  like cranes are flying         this

stealing what food they have  forcing them under duress to become their informant eyes and ears  what russian soldiers are left hide under cover of forests  but are forced to send food expeditions to

gostyukhin as rybak  while the other  boris plotnikov as sotnikov  is slowed down by a tubercular sounding cough and eventually a bullet in his leg that nearly leaves him for dead  but his partner

becomes their toughest foe  br    br   spoilers   everything is reduced to a matter of survival  when they reach their destination  the farm has been demolished and left in a state of rubble  pushing forward into german occupied territory where the next farm is manned by an elderly soviet collaborator who fears nazi retribution  the partisan soldiers think him a coward but move on  where they are eventually captured and brought to a nazi camp in a nearby town and held as prisoners  along with a proud and protective mother  lyudmila polyakova  who helped hide them  tarkovsky stalwart anatoli solonitsyn appears as portnov the interrogator  a russian teacher from a nearby academy turned nazi sympathizer  russians torturing and executing fellow russians is the depth of war depravity and solonitsyn is brilliant in the despicable role he s perfectly suited for  from what we can see  as nazi officers chat jovially in close proximity to one another  he is an outsider even among this group  seen instead as a kind of gruesome black cloaked undertaker who routinely sends men to their graves  the audience is not spared from witnessing acts of torture on sotnikov  who offers nothing but contempt  while rybak speaks freely  hoping to save his life  but both are condemned to die  though rybak is offered a chance to serve the german reich as a police agent  the mother  the elderly collaborator  and a child are added to this group  spending one last night together alive where together they discuss the merits of a soldier s mission  of being a patriot  a mother  a coward  or a collaborator  each seems individually driven by a desperate need to survive  but sotnikov offers himself as a selfless example  attempting to confess his guilt to spare the others  where the aptly chosen title reflects his spiritual redemption  br    br   by the next morning  portnov seems mildly amused  mocking them at their sudden willingness to talk  but spares no one except rybak  who changes sides to keep his life  rationalizing in his thoughts that if he s alive  at least he has a chance to escape  but there is no escape not from this torment  what happens is shown with exquisite delicacy and poetic grace  as we witness the treachery of war without a single shot being fired  as the execution by hanging is turned into a public spectacle  where the villagers at the point of a gun are forced to witness  the pace and harrowing intensity of this film is relentless  as there is never a moment without impending menace  gorgeously shot by vladimir chukhnov  who died in the same car accident as shepitko   featuring perfectly composed landscapes and plenty of camera movement  much of it at close range using portraitures  especially that of a fierce young boy at the end who eyes the condemned men  who makes a surreal connection to the next generation without any words being spoken  accentuated by the psychologically horrific music of alfred shnittke which resembles the transcendent yet furiously disturbing monolith music from kubrick s       a space odyssey         the sound design of this film is highly advanced and uniquely modern  where the use of off screen sound continually exposes the raw nerves of each moment  dogs barking  wind blowing  bullets firing  nearby nazi s chattering in untranslated german or laughing sadistically at their helplessness  which only ratchets up the hideous tension to insane heights  in many ways resembling dreyer s the passion of joan of arc         utter insanity is exposed here  the relentless realization that you

lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed  what might drive some viewers nuts is that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they re watch the film and try to pay close observation to every single frame  br    br   what  exactly  does this line of dialogue mean  the horror spoken of is the reality of war  the reality of moral men being so easily corrupted that they turn on their inborn instincts and kill fellow beings without any sign of guilt  when capt  willard  martin sheen  stands before the dying col  kurtz  marlon brando  at the end of the film   the horror the horror   is the realization of willard s corruptness  he has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his assignment  this isn t a typical hollywood ending  in most cases a character gains something  whether it be emotionally  physically  mentally or all three  but willard both gains and loses  he gains the knowledge that he has lost his morals  and that is a shocking ending  br    br    apocalypse now  is francis ford coppola s tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking  this film is wholly different from  the godfather   it is hallucinogenic  visually dazzling  and an ode to the guilty side of human nature  at first it seems realistic  and then it becomes strange  and then symbolic  and  by the end  original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of warfare  this is not as much a film about the vietnam war as it is a film about the war within us  br    br   at first it does appear to be another war film  captain willard  sheen  is assigned by an army lieutenant  a young harrison ford  to assassinate a renegade american colonel named kurtz  brando   who is hiding out somewhere in vietnam with a hoard of troops who more or less act as his slaves  br    br   willard carries out his mission  with extreme prejudice   heading out on a boat along with four soldiers  including the boat captain  chief  albert hall   chef  frederic forest   and a very young  larry  fishburne  who later went on to appear as morpheus in  the matrix    br    br    apocalypse now   is in a many ways a modern update of homer s odyssey  as our main character  willard  carries on his journey  he meets an array of original and strange characters  including lt  col  kilgore  robert duvall   who has a strange fetish for surfing  and a stoned photographer  dennis hopper   whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the very much lesser jeremy davies in   the million dollar hotel    one of the worst films i have ever seen  davies failed to make any connection with an audience  hopper does  he is like the poetic vibe between willard and kurtz  he is like an interpreter going back and forth and speaking in foreign languages  in this case  he is translating kurtz to willard  although i m not so sure kurtz needs a translation of willard  br    br   many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines    apocalypse now   has many  kilgore descending upon a vietnam village playing wagner s   ride of the valkyries   remains one of the most remembered scenes in all of film history  there is sharpness to it  a brutality to it  an ironic tone to it  and also a sense of playfulness  when kilgore kneels down on that beach and says   i love the smell of napalm in the morning it smells like victory   we all crack a smile  br    br   i won t lie to you   apocalypse now  is a strange film  it isn t exactly the easiest thing to analyze  the end may frustrate some viewers if they don t understand marlon brando s significant speeches  but what it all comes down to  what really matters  is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche  the horror is the realization of war and its effects  not the war itself  kurtz says   you have a right to kill me  but you have no right to judge me   brando s character  kurtz  is left to the audience to judge  to many na ve viewers he may appear as a crazy loon whose power got to his head  but that isn t what francis ford coppola is trying to get across  by fighting in vietnam  kurtz has realized just how great he had it  and how bad some others had it  by walking through devastated villages he eventually comes to realize that we are the na ve ones  living our lives in a fool s paradise  we are totally na ve to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they hit  by seeing how unlucky some vietnamese are  kurtz realizes just how easily he could be struck by something  just how easily he could end up like the people around him  and he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door  many people think the horror is one thing  it is two  for kurtz  the horror is the reality of how na ve he was and the reality of the war s impact upon men  and after willard murders kurtz  and hears kurtz s dying words  he realizes it too  he realizes the effects of war  to see so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man  and what it has done to him  the horror  br    br       stars   br

       " 'as salinger s  a perfect day for bananafish   ends with the suicide of a prodigy  this movie opens with the death of the star high school swimmer legend  matt  who shoots himself in the head with a revolver after in the opening scene  but the death of matt travis serves as a key to unlock the door of another prodigy  his brother  tim who never in his life seriously bothered with the question    what am i going to do    br    br   when he finds his brother dead  his head broken like a dropped watermelon  the travis family starts vomiting out its secrets one by one  the film focuses on tim  he is a victim of bullying  domestic abuse  family alienation  heartbreak  issues of sexuality and friendship   br    br   tim reveals his wounds by physical bruises  but these are not the only injuries to his person  as we slowly come to realize  as the script painfully unveils the origins and outcome of tim scars  everyone who loves him hurts him  hirsch plays out the character quite well  revealing frame after frame in the visual expression of his body  a host of conflicting emotions inside the soul of a kid whom no one seems to listen to or know very well  unknowing and unaware of his depth of soul and prodigious talent   br    br   two siblings sharing a doobie  curled up on a red  spinnable playground saucer  tim asks penny    what am i going to do with the rest of my life    the scene is framed in a familiar  recurring image of the film  the comfortable playground where tim obviously feels at home  filmed from a bird s eye view  because with every character tim feels comfortable to share a part of himself  and we view these intimate moments he shares in the red  spinnable playground saucer  complete with childish graffiti carved in pencil  from above  after advising him curtly to pass the joint  penny tells him    tim  well  the secret to the success of life is to find something you love  and you have to do that for the rest of your life   and you better hope to hell that you re good at it because if you re not then you ll probably fail    this simple line of advice from penny serves as the movie s central theme  the responsibility of talent and the possibility of failure  why does one person have a talent he cannot stand  like matt  who hated the attention his swimming fame brought  but no one notices tim s talent   no one   because no one bothers to ask him  not even us  the film makes us aware that we ourselves do not know tim as well as we thought we did when we first meet this handsome  sad  guy  in our intimate understanding of tim  as it progresses  we are reminded that not everyone is as they seem to be  this is the other side of the film  the failure of those who should   parents  friends  teachers   whoever   to notice and see the gifts of the people they claim to love  not even his mother sandy  played by sigourney weaver  sees tim s gift  despite her love for her son  weaver does a deft job of a middle aged woman grappling with her own inner demons as she haphazardly tries to play the roles of domesticity and support  when tim is found to be bullied at school  she storms the boy s trailer  threatening his life    you can tease  torture  punch  drive drunk with me  i can forgive you  hell i can understand it  i m a good christian  you know  i can forgive and forget  but you mess with my kid and may god himself descend from heaven to protect you because as long as i live   and i will outlive you all   i will wake up and go to sleep at night just dreaming of ways to make your petty insignificant lives into hell on earth    after flicking a paper cup into the mother s face  she looks around the trailer  and looking at them both  the kid and his stunned mother  comments    nice trailer   and leaves as quickly as she came  weaver scores in her ability to match gusto with visceral wit that is acid and witty  and tim s father  played by jeff daniels  is blind to who his son is  treating him like a stranger  not telling his family that he took time off from the office  spending his days in the city park  listless  a carved out soul  and sleeping in matt s bed  tucked in with his high school letter jacket  jeff daniels does a superb job of making us believe that he can be both a bastard and lovable because  we grow to see that even an inept father can show his love for his son  in an emotional scene  tim confronts his father  just when you think his dad is going to hit him  he grabs for him to embrace him  not letting him go  he tells tim    i am your father and you re are my son and i m here okay but you ve gotta talk to me  i don t know how to do this by myself    it is here at this moment in the film that a father tells his son  you have to tell me what s going on inside of you  you have to tell me who you are  i want to know who you are  it is in this scene that the film reaches a cathartic moment  the visual movement from tim  angry and alone  to his father embracing him as he breaks downs and weeps  revealing the emotions hidden beneath his shell  tim experiences this moment of cleansing with his dad as a catharsis  especially when you consider the mistreatment  manipulation  disregard  violence and betrayal he has been dealt in the long year the film encompasses  i recommend this film  ',\n",

       " 'i m currently slogging through gibbon s  fall and decline of the roman empire   so i ve had all things roman on my mind  i m not very far into it yet  maybe two hundred plus pages  but it is amazing just how many of these roman emperors were killed  i believe i ve read through maybe    emperors so far and only antonius  trajan  and hadrian haven t been killed or at least suspected of having been killed  i have also been fascinated by the mad excesses of many of these princes of rome  not the least practitioner of these was caligula  this brings me to reviewing this film  i m thinking of the film on a historical basis as far as i understand it from gibbon s explanation of rome as well as other research from some good web sites and some fiction novels dealings with the period  br    br   my point is i do not think that this film is what it is thought to be by many of it s proponents  i do not think the depravity shown with the sex and horrendous violence of this film qualify it as accurate  the general ideas of the film seem accurate  caligula is raised on an island  exiled with his family and in content fear of being murdered by the increasingly mad  suspicious and strange emperor tiberius  he grows up paranoid and afraid and can never shake the cutesy nickname given him by his guards  little boots  this helps him grow up feeling abused and powerless  he is handed the empire after tiberius dies  the senate hoping he will steer away from the informer squads which brought death by whim of the former delusionally paranoid tyrant  and lead rome away from the madness that dictator had settled it into  caligula begins as a decent if hands off emperor  but gets sick  almost dies  and comes back from the brink of feverous death a true monster  his perversities with his sisters do begin here  if not before  he does have macro killed and many others who were his originally supporters  the acts of madness seemed not to be the murders of caligula as much as his new thinking of himself as a living god  him seen talking to the statue of jupiter as an equal doomed him  his violent mad excesses would have doomed him anyway  and three years seems to have been quite a decent run for the successors of tiberius  well the film basically sticks to these lines while it manages to be coherent  which is not common through it s entirety  it does so while trying to shock the audience at all turns  in every single scene the film begs you to be disgusted by the depravity of ancient rome  the shocking scenes are what this film is built entirely upon and where it entirely fails  it is just too much to see successive rulers have man after man murdered  raped  tortured for no reason but fancy  the depictions of the violence are possibly  but not probably  accurate  murder certainly was the order of the day in imperial rome  torture beforehand was rote  but the director s visions of these deaths and the bored amusement of their protagonists  while the bystanders watch with nonchalance  i just don t see it having gone down exactly like that  the death machine  the beheader  is certainly something like you ve never seen in movies  and something once seen you shall probably never forget  even as i  you wish you could  the wine drinking while the penis is roped off is the same  once you ve seen this shame it is yours forever  these things strike me the director s and that porn magnate s fantasies  they sprung from their sick imaginations and not from any proved record  br    br   the acting is pretty good  i actually think mcdowell is the weakest link here  mirren is always something to behold  and here in her youthful years she is formidable and beautiful  the portrayals of nerva and tiberius are done very well by their respected actors  the film could have done so much better story telling  it is such a failure that way its just a whole other layer of what a shame this thing was  for example it could have given opinion on how and why caligula went mad  or shown that he was mad  paranoid before his illness and that fever then broke the mental restraint he had possessed previously  it could have shown the weakness of claudius and the miracle it was he survived caligula  it could have these and many other things but it stuck to it s sad nightmares  br    br   finally about the sex  it is porn  it shows these sex acts being done all over the palaces by many people  male on male  female on female  male on female  it is passionless  disgusting sex  sex that if your point is to get off on it  i seriously doubt you could  both tiberius and caligula may have been sex addicts  and orgies may have been common enough but the visions in this film seem to recall more a greek time than a roman  i don t think that kind of acceptance of homosexuality or orgies right out in the open were common until the the strange  depraved reign of elgabalus  and he was killed for it  br    br   this film should probably never be watched  if your curious about it   let it go  it is something  as i said earlier  if you do watch this you will unfortunately retain it s sick visions in your minds eye for years to come  i don t think its an accurate historical picture in particular  even if it is historical in whole ',\n",

       " 'ray is interesting in parts  and technically it s very well made  but ray is often sluggish  and forgets some important details about ray s life  all the movie shows us is parts where he s in his prime  and most successful  which is good  it s just i wanted to see some bits about his older life too  jamie fox mimics ray charles to a t  at times it s absolutely uncanny  i have to say  jamie is the reason i got through this movie  the  st half is a lot better then the  nd  it s more interesting  it has more oomph  and it s nowhere near as sluggish as the  nd  i wasn t a big fan of ray charles to begin with to be honest  so i really didn t have any expectations for the film  what so ever  ray s biggest problem had to be the over length  this could ve been cut very easily  with more relevant scenes  other then the ones they used  i found the early part of ray s life when he was just starting to get successful  the most interesting  he was humble back then  and somewhat a gentleman  and while the film may have over exaggerated his actions  he got a bit too full of himself for me to care  br    br   performance  jamie fox gives a performance for the ages as ray  he looks like ray  talks like ray  acts like ray  he even sings like ray   this is much more then an impression  i truly believed he was  ray charles  he was the heart of the film  and without his presence  this film would ve been a complete and utter bore  br    br   bottom line  ray is interesting at times  dreadfully dull at others  when all was said and done  i was disappointed by how routine it seemed at times  just because it s a bibliographical film  doesen t mean it s automatically oscar worthy  jamie fox deserved his oscar  but the movie is above average at best  worth a watch  but if i were you  i d keep my expectations at a rather comfortable level  br    br       ',\n",
       " ' st watched               out of    dir mario pinzauti   silly  sex filled master   slave having too many intimate relations movie  this movie seemed to care more about the sex than the story and kind of worked the story around the sex  laughable dubbing of the original italian language in the version i watched with ridiculous ending where the attempt is made to give an anti slave statement or should i say one line   what a waste of time for everyone who watches this trash ',\n",
